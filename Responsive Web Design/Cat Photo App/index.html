<!-- The main element is used to represent the main content of the body of an HTML document. Content inside the main element should be unique to the document and should not be repeated in other parts of the document. -->

<!-- The section element is used to define sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document. It is a semantic element that helps with SEO and accessibility.-->

<!-- The figure element represents self-contained content and will allow you to associate an image with a caption. A figure caption (figcaption) element is used to add a caption to describe the image contained within the figure element.-->

<!-- The form element is used to get information from a user like their name, email, and other details. The action attribute indicates where form data should be sent. In order for a form's data to be accessed by the location specified in the action attribute, you must give the text field a name attribute and assign it a value to represent the data being submitted. -->

<!-- You can use radio buttons for questions where you want only one answer out of multiple options. -->

<!-- label elements are used to help associate the text for an input element with the input element itself (especially for assistive technologies like screen readers). -->

<!-- There's another way to associate an input element's text with the element itself. You can nest the text within a label element and add a for attribute with the same value as the input element's id attribute. -->

<!-- Notice that both radio buttons can be selected at the same time. To make it so selecting one radio button automatically deselects the other, both buttons must have a name attribute with the same value. -->

<!-- The fieldset element is used to group related inputs and labels together in a web form. fieldset elements are block-level elements, meaning that they appear on a new line. -->
 
<!-- The legend element acts as a caption for the content in the fieldset element. It gives users context about what they should enter into that part of the form. -->

<!-- Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer. The input element with a type attribute set to checkbox creates a checkbox. -->
